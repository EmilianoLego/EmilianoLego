Hi, I’m Emiliano Legorreta

With a background in Business Administration, I'm bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. I build with a purpose: to drive real-world impact through decentralized technologies.

 Let’s Collaborate

I’m open to internships, bounties, and early-stage Web3 projects.  
If you're building something meaningful in crypto, let’s connect!
